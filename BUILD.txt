Build instruction for nwc2xml.

As of Now(May 2012), building nwc2xml is support only in Windows and Mac OS X platform.
Visual Studio 2005/2010 for Windows or Xcode for Mac OS X with wxWidgets 2.8 are required to build nwc2xml.

1. Install wxWidgets 2.8 and build Unicode static library.
Open $WXWIDGETS\build\msw\wx.dsw, select Unicode Debug/Unicode Release configuration and build it,
where $WXWIDGETS is the wxWidgets 2.8 installation directory.

2. Set environment variable WXWIDGETS to top level of wxWidgets library.
i.e. WXWIDGETS=C:\projects\wxWidgets

3. Open $nwc2xml\build\msw\nwc2xml_vc8.sln or $nwc2xml\build\msw\nwc2xml_vc10.sln and build Debug/Release configuration,
where $nwc2xml is the root directory of nwx2xml.
